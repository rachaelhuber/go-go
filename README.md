Data Structures and Algorithms

Implemented:

Sorting:
* BubbleSort - Runtime: O(n2) average and worst case. Memory O(1). Stable
* SelectionSort - Runtime: O(n2) average and worst case. Memory: O(1). Not Stable
* QuickSort - Runtime: O(nlogn) average, worst case O(n2). Memory: O(logn)
* MergeSort - Runtime: O(nlogn) average and worst case. Needs a lot of extra memory

Searching:
* Depth First Search (DFS)
* Breadth First Search (BFS)
* Binary Search - using Array
